## Build

### Prerequisites

First let's clone this git repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mvs-org/betelgeuse
cd betelgeuse
```
Install Rust Developer Environment and all required tools:
```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
source ~/.cargo/env
```
Install necessary dependencies. On Ubuntu, run the following:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y cmake pkg-config libssl-dev git gcc build-essential clang libclang-dev
```
Install this specific Rust nightly version that is known to be compatible with the version of Substrate we are using:
```bash
rustup install nightly-2020-10-06
```
Now, configure the nightly version to work with the Wasm compilation target:
```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly-2020-10-06
```
Now you can start building your node:
```bash
cargo +nightly-2020-10-06 build --release
```
### Mining

#### Step 1 - create your wallet
Access Web Wallet using URL: http://95.111.250.21:2028/ and create a new wallet account and write down your mnemonic seed.
 
Youâ€™ll use the mnemonic it for accessing your account and for signed mining. 
For example supposing you've finished build your node earlier and your current directory is betelgeuse: 
```bash
./target/release/betelgeuse import-mining-key "razor limb price drum rifle robust stock cake coral chase pioneer shoot" --chain ./betelgeuse.json
```
You will get the following output: 2021-01-14 04:11:48  Registered one mining key (public key 0x80b9fcd9a5ff3bb238a9c084803eedc194f0592749bfb88d14f82baffaf67f7).

#### Step 2 - import mining key
```bash
./target/release/betelgeuse import-mining-key "razor limb price drum rifle robust stock cake coral chase pioneer shoot" --chain ./betelgeuse.json
```
You will get the following output: 2021-01-14 04:11:48  Registered one mining key (public key 0x80b9fcd9a5ff3bb238a9c084803eedc194f0592749bfb88d14f82baffaf67f7).

#### Step 3 - start mining
```bash
./target/release/betelgeuse --author "0x80b9fcd9a5ff3bb238a9c084803eedc194f0592749bfb88d14f82baffaf67f7b" --validator --name AdrianVPS --chain ./betelgeuse.json
```

The syntax of the command to run a node and start mining is:
./betelgeuse --author "<your public key>" --validator --name <node name> --chain ./betelgeuse.json 
  
*You only have to change your node name and your public key obtained in the previous step and you should start mining.

#### Step 3 - check mining results
You can check the node synchronization and other data using the Web wallet located at the following URL:  
http://95.111.250.21:2028/
